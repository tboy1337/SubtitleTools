00:00:00.080 I brought along my son Jonathan who in
00:00:02.320 the year 2001 will be the same age as I
00:00:05.279 am now maybe he will be better adjusted
00:00:07.439 to this kind of world that you're trying
00:00:09.320 to portray the big difference when he
00:00:12.200 grows up in fact we wanted to wait for
00:00:13.839 the year 2001 is that he will have in
00:00:16.600 his own house not a computer as big as
00:00:19.039 this but at least a console through
00:00:22.199 which you can talk to his friendly local
00:00:24.599 computer and get all the information he
00:00:25.960 needs for his everyday life like his
00:00:27.840 bank statements his theater observations
00:00:30.920 all the information you need in the
00:00:33.760 course of living in a complex modern
00:00:35.840 society this will be in
00:00:37.680 a compact form in his own house you'll
00:00:40.719 have a television screen like this here
00:00:43.320 and a keyboard and you'll talk to the
00:00:44.840 computer get information from it and
00:00:46.160 he'll take it as much for granted as we
00:00:47.680 take the telephone I wonder though what
00:00:49.680 sort of a life would it be like in
00:00:51.440 Social terms I mean if our whole life is
00:00:54.000 built around the computer that we become
00:00:55.480 a computer dependent society and
00:00:57.520 computer independent individuals in some
00:01:00.160 ways but they'll also enrich our society
00:01:02.719 because it'll make it possible for us to
00:01:04.479 live ready anywhere we like any
00:01:07.240 businessman any executive could live
00:01:09.880 almost anywhere on Earth and still do
00:01:11.880 his business through a device like this
00:01:14.159 and this is a wonderful thing it means
00:01:15.439 we wanted to be stuck in cities we
00:01:17.479 better live out in in the country or
00:01:19.240 wherever we please and still carry on
00:01:21.920 complete interaction with human
00:01:23.759 beings as well as with other computers
